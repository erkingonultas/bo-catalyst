Totally fair—let’s decode what you’re seeing.

# What the two plots mean

## 1) `pareto.png` (cost space of your dataset)

* **X-axis**: `|ΔG_H* − target|` in eV. We set `target = 0.0`, so **smaller is better** (closer to Sabatier optimum).
* **Y-axis**: `E_hull` in eV/atom. **Smaller is better** (more thermodynamically stable).
* **Dots = all data points** you currently have.
* **X markers = Pareto set**: the **non-dominated** points—the best trade-offs you can achieve *with the data you have*.
  “Non-dominated” = no other point is better in both objectives simultaneously.

👉 Interpretation: the **lower-left** region is “ideal” (near-optimal activity *and* high stability). The X-marked points trace the boundary of what’s currently possible given your dataset.

## 2) `suggestions.png` (what BO wants you to try next)

* This is a 1D plot of **`x_Ni`** (so `x_Cu = 1 − x_Ni`).
* Each dot is a **suggested composition** from the qEHVI acquisition function.
* qEHVI proposes points that are likely to **improve the Pareto front** (increase hypervolume) given your current uncertainty—some are exploitation near your good region, some are exploration where the model is uncertain.

👉 Interpretation: if you see suggestions clustered around, say, **x_Ni ≈ 0.4–0.6**, the model “believes” the **Ni–Cu alloy window** there might improve the trade-off. Suggestions near **0 or 1** are encouraging you to re-check the monometallic ends (either because they look promising or the model is still uncertain there).

# How this ties to the numbers we fed BO

We transformed your dataset into:

* **Activity objective**: `y1_activity = − |ΔG_H* − 0.0|` → larger is better (closer to 0 eV).
* **Stability objective**: `y2_stability = − E_hull` → larger is better (more stable).

For visualization, we plotted the **costs** (i.e., the negatives of those two) so you can see “lower is better” in both axes. The **Pareto set** in `pareto.png` matches the **best observed** trade-offs in your current data; the BO suggestions aim to push that boundary outward.

# What to do with the suggestions

1. **Pick a small, diverse batch** (e.g., 3–6) covering the range of suggested `x_Ni` values instead of all being bunched together.
2. **Evaluate** them (via calculations or experiments) to get new `ΔG_H*` and `E_hull`.
3. **Append results** to `data/processed.parquet` → regenerate `bo_dataset.parquet` → **re-run** BO.
   This closes the loop and should move your Pareto set further down/left over iterations.

# Quick sanity heuristic (rules of thumb)

* **Activity**: good ΔG_H* for HER typically lies near **0 eV**; values **too negative** (e.g., < −0.4 eV) bind H too strongly; **too positive** (e.g., > +0.4 eV) bind too weakly.
* **Stability**: many studies use **`E_hull ≤ 0.2 eV/atom`** as a rough “feasible” filter. Closer to **0** is better.

# If you want a bit more insight

I can add one or both:

* A **table view** that lists each **Pareto point** (composition, ΔG_H*, E_hull).
* A **composition sweep plot**: `ΔG_H*` vs `x_Ni` and `E_hull` vs `x_Ni` overlayed, to see where trade-offs happen along the alloy line.

But at a glance: look for **X-markers trending toward the lower-left** in `pareto.png`, and **suggestions** nudging you toward regions that could push that frontier further.
